# IWD C# developer challenge

## Setup

Unity3D 2018.3.12 ( https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/8afd630d1f5b/Windows64EditorInstaller/UnitySetup64-2018.3.12f1.exe ) and a C# editor such as Visual Studio

## Guidelines

We would like to test your ability to understand existing code, as well as your capacity of either implementing unit tests or learning how to do it. \
Our tests are implemented using Moq and NUnit, you have all the necessary includes and assembly definitions provided. 

## Content

We have provided a small module that implements saving files to a cache, and retrieving them. \
The main class is FileCacheStorage, and this is the one we want to test. \
We have provided the FileCacheStorageTest file to get you started, so all you need to do is write your test functions inside. \
We aim at unit testing rather than integration or end-to-end tests. \
The naming convention we usually follow for unit tests is `MyFunction_DoThis_When_SomethingHappens`, allowing to clarify the intent of the test. \
The tests should run in Unity's Test Runner.
